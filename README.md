This is a chess engine under development that will use an evaluation function based on the [chessbrah chess habits series](https://imgur.com/a/342h1p0?nc=1).


## How to Use:
```
// install dependencies
yarn install

// compile
yarn dev

// run server
npx webpack serve
```

You can then play the engine at localhost:8080
